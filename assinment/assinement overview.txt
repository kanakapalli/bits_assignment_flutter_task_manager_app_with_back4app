Flutter CRUD App with Back4App (BaaS)

 

Project Title:

Task Manager App – A Flutter-Based CRUD Application Using Back4App (BaaS)

Project Overview:

This project is a Flutter-based Task Manager Application that utilizes Back4App as a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS). Students will develop an app that enables user authentication and task management using a cloud backend without needing to build a custom server.

Why Use Back4App (BaaS)?

No need to set up or manage a backend manually.
Provides ready-to-use authentication and database services.
Offers real-time data storage and retrieval for the Flutter app.
Allows quick deployment and scalability.
Key Features:

✔User Authentication – Register and login using a student email ID.
✔CRUD Operations on Tasks – Users can Create, Read, Update, and Delete tasks.
✔Backend as a Service (BaaS) – No need to write backend code, as Back4App handles data storage.
✔Real-Time Database Syncing – Task updates are reflected dynamically.
✔Secure Logout – Users can safely log out.

Technology Stack:

Frontend: Flutter (Dart)
Backend: Back4App (Parse Server)
Database: Back4App Cloud Database
Version Control: GitHub
Hosting: Local device for development
App Flow:

User Registration & Login:
Users register and log in using their student email ID.
User credentials are stored securely in Back4App's authentication system.
Task Management (CRUD):

Users can create tasks with a title and description.
Tasks are stored in Back4App’s cloud database.
Users can edit or delete tasks, and the app will sync with the backend in real time.
Logout:

Users can securely log out, and their session will be invalidated.
